# Non-Functional (NFRs)

## NFR1: Responsive and Lightweight
As a user, I want the platform to load quickly and run smoothly so that I don't waste time waiting for pages to load.

## NFR2: Easy to Use
As a user, I want the interface to be simple and intuitive so that I can use it without needing help or training.

## NFR3: Easy to Maintain
As a developer, I want the code to be well organized and easy to extend so that I can add new meal types or dietary categories without rewriting everything.

## NFR4: Data Reliability
As a user, I want my order information to be saved reliably so that I don't lose my orders if something goes wrong with the system.

## NFR5: Scalable
As a system administrator, I want the platform to handle multiple users at once so that it doesn't crash during busy times.
