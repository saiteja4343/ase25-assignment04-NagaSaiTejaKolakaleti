# Selected Requirements for Prototype

## Chosen Functional Requirement
**FR3: Search Meals**
As a user, I want to search for meals by name, ingredient, or category like vegan or gluten-free so that I can quickly find meals that match my needs.

## Chosen Non-Functional Requirement
**NFR3: Easy to Maintain**
As a developer, I want the code to be well organized and easy to extend so that I can add new meal types or dietary categories without rewriting everything.

## Justification

I picked the search functionality because it's one of the most important features for users. When someone visits SmartCater, they usually have something specific in mind - maybe they want vegan meals or need something with chicken. Without search, they would have to look through everything manually which takes too long.

For the non-functional requirement, I chose maintainability because it directly affects how I write the search feature. If I organize the code properly with clear classes and methods, it will be easy to add more search filters later or change how the search works. For example, if we want to add a new category like "high-protein" meals, I can just add it without breaking existing code.

These two requirements work together well. A good search system needs clean code structure to handle different search types (by name, ingredient, category). If the code is messy, adding new search options becomes really difficult. By focusing on maintainability while building search, I'm making sure the prototype is actually useful for future development.

The scope is reasonable for a prototype because I can demonstrate basic search with a few sample meals. I don't need to build the whole ordering system or delivery tracking yet. Just showing that users can find meals based on different criteria proves the concept works.
